        <h2>About the band</h2>
        <div class="description" id="tribute-info">   <!--6-->
            <p>Amesoeurs was a French post-punk/post-black metal band. A side project of Neige of Alcest, the group was formed with musicians Audrey Sylvain and Fursy Teyssier in the summer of 2004. Their goal was to create music that "reflects the dark side of the industrial era and modern civilization".</p>

            <p>Shortly after Amesoeurs's formation, a few songs were written and the band performed a gig, but Fursy decided to leave the band to return to his studies. In April 2005, a first 3 track EP entitled Ruines Humaines was self-recorded. Neige had left the black metal band Mortifera at the time and he used two tracks ("Bonheur Amput√©" and "Ruines Humaines") he had originally composed for Mortifera for Amesoeurs's EP. The EP was finally released through Northern Silence Productions from Germany in 2006.</p>
